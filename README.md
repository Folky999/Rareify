# Rareify
Rareify is a platform that weâ€™re selling or buying a digital asset such as Arts which is what we called NFT marketplace. Rareify aims to support creators and Artist to sell their digital assets and express their Art though our website. In the other hand, we also support buyers or collectors in the way of saving time and space
## Project Overview
Our project is tackling the common problems in managing Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs), such as inefficiencies, fraud, and a lack of transparency. Traditional systems are slow, often lead to disputes, and make it hard to enforce rights. We are offering a solution with a blockchain-based platform that keeps clear, unchangeable records of IP transactions. By using blockchain and smart contracts, we can automate the enforcement of IP rights and make the entire process more transparent and secure.

The platform uses innovative technologies like blockchain and cryptography, and our team has deep knowledge in these areas, along with experience in IP law and cybersecurity. We aim to make IP management simpler, more secure, and less costly. Our platform will help users manage their IP more effectively, cut down on fraud, and lower expenses. Right now, we have a working prototype and are running pilot tests to get feedback and make improvements. Our next steps include scaling up, ensuring everything meets regulatory requirements, and preparing to launch the platform to a larger audience.
